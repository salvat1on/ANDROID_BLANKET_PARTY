REM #TITLE: Android 13 Payload
REM #AUTHOR: $@LVAT10N!
REM #DESCRIPTION: Android payload to support android 13. This payload will 
REM # brute force a 4 digit pin. The first five strings you can add possible 
REM # pins gathered from recon data by replacing the x's with pins or delete 
REM # these lines if you just want random generated pins.The pin length can be 
REM # modified by X string length and changing the $CHAR variable number in the 
REM # extension.
REM # This is a run once script intended for engagements.
